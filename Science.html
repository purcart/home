		<h2>General Info on Chlorine</h2>	
			<p>Chlorine is an interesting element, and has some history on it as well.The origin of chlorine came from the Greek word “Chloros” meaning greenish yellow. Chlorine is in group 17, period 3, in block P,  has an atomic number of 17, and chlorine is in a gas state <a href="http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/17/chlorine">(Royal Society of Chemistry)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Chlorine was produced for the first time by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Wilhelm-Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a>. Carl Wilhelm was a chemist by trait when he combined the mineral pyrolusite (MnO2) with Hydrochloric acid (HCi) in 1774, when Carl did this experiment he thought that the gas produced was oxygen, but Sir Humphry Davy proved that this gas was a distinct element in 1810 <a href="http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele017.html">(Jefferson Lab)</a>.

		<h3>About Carl Wilhelm Scheele</h3>
			<p>Carl Wilhelm Scheele was a German Swedish chemist who discovered oxygen, chlorine, and manganese independently. In 1774 Carl was pushed to publish the experiment with black magnesia(pyrolusite). Scheele had to treat the material with muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), then Scheele noticed an unknown gas being developed. He then called it “dephlogisticated muriatic acid” (chlorine). He also thought that black magnesia contained a new mineral (manganese) sadly, he was unable to isolate the mineral.</p> 
		<h2>The use in World War One</h2>
			<p>At the outbreak of WW1 in 1914 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fritz-Haber">Fritz Haber</a>, a chemist by trait, offered to help the German army. He began experimenting the Chlorine gas  to be used in the trench warfare. This really made the opposing army suffer, since chlorine gas has an effect makes your death slow and painful <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWchlorine.htm">(Spartacus Educational)</a>.</p>
			<p>Gas masks were made prier the result of the “poison gas” that killed a lot of soldiers. Early gas masks were not to be used in warfare. The mask was given some protective eyepiece that would break easily. This made the Hypo Helmet.</p>

		<h3>About Fritz Haber</h3>
			<p>Fritz Haber was a German physical chemist and winner of the Nobel prize for Chemistry for his successful work on nitrogen fixation. With the coming of WW1, Haber devoted most of his resources of his research to the German military, because of their demands for chemical products. The German military was looking for possible tear gases and irritants, which led Harber to purpose to use Chlorine gas <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/the-western-front-in-world-war-one/gas-masks-in-world-war-one/">(The History Learning Site)</a>.</p>
