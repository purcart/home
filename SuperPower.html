		<p>This superpower is basically describing my physical ability to play sports. I am able to play all sports considering my size and strength in able to play almost any position in soccer, street hockey, baseball/softball, and volleyball. I'm not the tallest, but because of my ability to analyze and understand the game and each position I need to play in to help the team out.My athletic ability is split up into different parts. One part is my ability to read and analyze the certain situation and the play. Using this I can easily know my part in the game so I can do my part.	My athletic ability is split up into two different parts. One part is my ability to read and analyze the certain situation and the play. Using this I can easily know my part in the game so I can do my part. The last part is applying what I need to do in that situation or that certain play so I can help my team win.

		<p>This superpower comes from a lot of time and effort and does not come easy. I got this superpower by following what my Muhamed Ali said, “I hated training every minute of training, but I said, Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.” So the way I achieved this power is by following this quote every time I train. This quote means work your butt off now than later you can relax and be the greatest you'll ever be. This changed my work ethic then later changed the way I look at studying and sports, and this is the way I achieved this power.

		<p>There are many things you can do with this superpower. One of the main things is you can tone your body out easier because of the change in work ethic. You are able to live a healthy life by staying active. You can play all the sports you want because of the way I was able to analyze the way others play in a certain position. If you do well, you might always be first pick when your playing. Also, you can use this and get jobs as a professional player or a personal trainer.
